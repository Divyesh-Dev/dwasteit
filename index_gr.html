          <p>Everyone enjoys the <strong>functions with a lot of food</strong> and other products and most of them <strong>left waste or unused.</strong> We all waste food for various reasons. Typically it’s as a result of there has been an amendment of plans and it’s out of our management, however, most of the time we tend <strong>to waste identical varieties of food</strong> for identical a pair of main reasons:</p>
          <p>We’ve got, bought or read an excessive amount of food, or we’ve got forgotten to use it on time. Regardless of the rationale why you throw out food, you got it. So, after you square measure throwing out food, or recording the food you’ve got wasted, cash A note the explanations for your scraps and see if there square measure tiny changes that you just will build to cut back this waste and prevent plenty of dollars.</p>
          <p><strong>To solve this problem,</strong> we come up with a system which can take request from the users who want get settle with the waste food ,they can request to donate or sell at cost to our systems managers who comes to them at given time and pick the order&nbsp;and further park that food to needy place where most people are without food according to need status . </p>
          <p>Hence <strong>our system takes feedbacks</strong> and gives it best to settle the need and cleaning the place and more or less doing humanity.</p>

          <p><strong>Why Waste Food Management System is Essential in Foodie World?</strong></p>
          <p>--&gt;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;<strong><em>1-</em></strong> <strong><em>Ignoring Kitchen Waste Management Costs You Money</em></strong>.</p>
          <p>Lack of restaurant kitchen waste management is one of the leading hidden reasons behind escalating food costs. You buy raw materials with money; hence if your kitchen ends up generating large amounts of waste, then it is you who is losing out on the money. Thus Waste Food Management System is Essential to reduce the loss of Money, raw material and food.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong><em>2-&nbsp;Impact the Environment in A Negative Way</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Food waste is increasingly becoming a growing area of concern for our community in terms of waste collection, disposal, and greenhouse gases. When rotting food in your restaurant ends up in a landfill, it turns into methane, a greenhouse gas that is particularly damaging to the environment. Food waste not only damages the environment it also wastes the valuable water and energy resources used to produce food.&nbsp;</p>
